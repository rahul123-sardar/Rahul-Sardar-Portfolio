        Hi, I’m <strong>Rahul Sardar</strong>, a motivated <strong>MERN Stack Developer</strong>
        and <strong>BCA student</strong> with a strong interest in building modern,
        scalable, and user-friendly web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with technologies such as <strong>React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</strong>,
        along with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. I enjoy turning ideas
        into real-world projects while focusing on clean code, performance,
        and responsive design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am actively seeking <strong>internship or entry-level developer opportunities</strong>
        where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals,
        and grow as a full-stack developer.
        
      </p>
